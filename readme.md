# Old HTML Canvas Window Manager

Was a lightweight HTML website featuring a canvas-based window manager. Its now on the way of transformation to my new web app.

The repo name in the future will be Web Based Fixture Console (FGM using HCW's)

## HCW Features only

- Create multiple windows on the canvas
- Drag windows around freely
- Resize windows dynamically

## Usage

Install express and run it via node.js open the site in the browser

## Planned Updates

- Currently rewriting everything to be a browser based Fixture console via ArtNet

## Current Status of the Fixture control

## NOTICE

All my commits are called "update" since this will be moved to a new repo after the first version of my Fixture console via ArtNet (Browser Based) is ready.
